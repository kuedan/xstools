EXPLANATION:

The folder of this tool will be your new Xonotic 'user directory', 
which is normally '~/.xonotic'.
The name of this folder is user-defined and can be named as you like.
'.xonotic' like default is possible for sure.

INSTALLATION:

1) Extract the .zip file of xstools (https://github.com/itsme-/xstools/archive/master.zip)
   and move this folder to a location you like and name this folder as you like.
   (Do not forget: This is your xonotic user directory)

2) Open xstools.conf in the subfolder 'scripts/' and define the location of your 
   Xonotic 'user directory' (folder, you extracted the .zip file to) and your 'basedirs'.
   You can define a 'basedir' for a Xonotic release, autobuild and git.
   Next to those folder variables there is an option to set the default version
   you are going to host. Set it to 'release' 'autobuild' or 'git'
   Please download the 'release' version on your own and extract it to the
   'basedir' location you have set for 'release'. (http://www.xonotic.org/download/)
   Autobuilds can be found here: http://beta.xonotic.org/autobuild/
   If you want to host git servers, you must clone Xonotic git. Therefore you
   can run './xstools.sh --install-git' (after you have set userdir and basedir
   for git servers in xstools.conf) ATTENTION: A compiler and libraries are needed.

3) Open 'xstools' (not xstools.sh) in this folder and fix the path of this script. 
   This means: 
   Rename 'please-fix-me' to the location of your new Xonotic 'user directory'
 
4) Move 'xstools' (not xstools.sh) to a folder which is part of your PATH variable.
   Now you can run xstools.sh from any location with the command 'xstools'.
   You can run Xonotic Server Tools with
   xstools 'arguments'
   eg: xstools --help
