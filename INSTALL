EXPLANATION:

The folder of this tool will be your new Xonotic 'user 
directory', which is normally '~/.xonotic'.
The name of this folder is user-defined and can be named
'.xonotic' like default for sure.

INSTALLATION:

1) Move this folder to a location you like 
   and name this folder as you like.
   (Do not forget: This is your user directory)

2) Open xstools.conf in the subfolder 'scripts/'
   and define the location of your Xonotic Git
   Installation and your Xonotic 'user directory'
   (basedir and userdir)
   If Xonotic git is not allready installed, you can
   run --install after you have set 'basedir' in 
   xstools.conf

3) Open 'xstools' (not xstools.sh) in this folder and 
   fix the path of this script. This means: 
   rename 'please-fix-me' to the location of your new
   Xonotic 'user directory'

4) Move 'xstools' (not xstools.sh) to a folder which 
   is part of your PATH variable.
   You can run Xonotic Server Tools now with
   xstools 'arguments'
   eg: xstools --help
