Put your rcon2irc configuration files into this folder 'configs/rcon2irc'.

IMPORTANT:
If you are loading extra plugins
... then use the full path '/home/user/..../plugin.pl'
... or you have to put them in this folder.
  - In the same folder like your configuration file, which is here :) -

Otherwise rcon2irc will not start!

HINT:
If rcon2irc is started at the same server like your Xonotic server, you can 
use 127.0.0.1 as dp_server. 127.0.0.1 means localhost.
